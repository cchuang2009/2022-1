      Why mathematican is not scientist,
      and Engineer is blind,
      and what can we call a physician?
      
A Mathematician, a physician, and a engineer were on a train toward to Scotland. They saw a black sheep on the field. 

"All the sheeps are black", engineer said.
"There is at least one sheep is black in Scotland.", physician said.
"No, no, the sheep in Scotland is one-half black.", the mathematician laughed.

Just open you mind to explore the world!
